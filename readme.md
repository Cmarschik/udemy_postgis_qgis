# GIS Coursework Repository

## What is this for?
This repository is for my classwork as a learn about PostQIS and QGIS during my course. Ultimately, it is so I can look back on it later.

## Is this good code/work?
Welp, could not tell you. That is up to your discression.

## What am I using to run this?
Dependent upon what this course entails, I may add a "requirements" text file 
for storing this info:
- PostgreSQL 10
- pgAdmin 4 v4
- QGIS 3.6
- PostGIS Extension

### Why isn't this code working if I try to run it?
Well, the code must not be copied and pasted. First and foremost, PostgreSQL user info will not match up exactly with yours. Not only that, if only spatial data ends up being worked on, it likely will be posted as binary... which is of course not super useful. Were that to be the case, this repository would simply act as a bookmark in my computer science journey.
