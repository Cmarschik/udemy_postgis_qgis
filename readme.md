# GIS Coursework Repository

## What is this for?
This repository is for my classwork as a learn about PostQIS and QGIS during my course. Ultimately, it is so I can look back on it later.

## Is this good code/work?
Welp, could not tell you. That is up to your discression.

## What am I using to run this?
All requirements are posted in the "requirements.txt" file.

### Why isn't this code working if I try to run it?
First and foremost, PostgreSQL user info will not match up exactly with yours. Not only that, much of the data is in datatypes that are not compatible with default computer setups... although I am sure anyone involved in GIS has ways to open these file types. Were it to be the case that you cannot open these files, this repository would simply act as a bookmark in my computer science journey.
