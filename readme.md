# GIS Coursework Repository

## What is this for?
This repository is for my classwork as a learn about PostQIS and QGIS during my course. Ultimately, it is so I can look back on it later.

## Is this good code/work?
Welp, could not tell you. That is up to your discression.

# What am I using to run this?
Dependent upon what this course entails, I may add a "requirements" text file 
for storing this info:
- PostgreSQL 10
- pgAdmin 4 v4
- QGIS 3.6
- PostGIS Extension

## Why isn't this code working if I try to run it?
Well, the code mus not be copied and pasted. First and foremost, PostgreSQL user info will not match up exactly with yours.
